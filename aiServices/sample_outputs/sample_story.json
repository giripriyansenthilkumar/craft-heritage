  "text": "Madhubani painting, also known as Mithila art, originated in the Mithila region of Bihar, India, over 2,500 years ago. This ancient art form was traditionally practiced by women of the region, who adorned the walls of their homes with intricate designs during festivals and special occasions. The paintings were created using natural dyes and pigments derived from plants, and the brushes were made from bamboo sticks and cotton. Over centuries, this sacred art form evolved from being a ritualistic practice to a celebrated cultural heritage, gaining international recognition in the 1960s when it was discovered by the wider world.\n\nThe artisans of Madhubani painting are predominantly women from rural Bihar, who have inherited this skill through generations of oral tradition and hands-on learning. These skilled artists create vibrant compositions featuring Hindu deities, nature motifs, and scenes from mythology, using bold lines and bright colors. The paintings hold deep cultural significance as they represent the region's spiritual beliefs, social customs, and connection to nature. Each symbol and motif carries specific meanings - fish represent fertility and good luck, peacocks symbolize love and romance, while the lotus represents purity and divine beauty. Today, Madhubani painting continues to be a vital source of livelihood for thousands of women artisans, preserving an invaluable piece of India's artistic legacy.",
