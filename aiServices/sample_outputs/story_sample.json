  "text": "Pottery in India is an ancient craft that dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization, around 3000 BCE. The art of shaping clay into functional and decorative items has been passed down through generations of skilled artisans. Traditional Indian pottery encompasses a wide range of styles, from the terracotta works of rural villages to the sophisticated blue pottery of Jaipur. The craft represents not just utility but also cultural identity, with each region developing its own distinctive techniques and designs.\n\nIndian potters, known as 'Kumhars', have maintained their craft through centuries, working with locally sourced clay and traditional firing methods. The pottery wheel, or 'chak', remains central to their practice, symbolizing the cyclical nature of creation. These artisans create everything from everyday cooking vessels to elaborate decorative pieces, each item bearing the mark of human hands and ancient wisdom. The craft continues to thrive in contemporary India, bridging the gap between traditional heritage and modern aesthetics.",
